Hi, welcome to VaxFinder! you've signed up for COVID-19 vaccine appointment alerts at retail pharmacies near you. I'll check for available appointments near you, and if I find something, I'll send you a text with a link to sign up. I'm pretty new, so know that I might be buggy and you probably shouldn't rely on me, but I'll do my best :)
        
If you got a shot or you'd like to stop receiving alerts, please reply with "rick" at any time. Thanks!`, from: fromPhone, to: phone})
